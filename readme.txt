DispenserButton - Put Buttons and Levers on Dispensers and Pistons
Version: v0.4

The Minecraft 1.6 release removed the ability to place buttons on dispensers. Before 1.6, 
placing a button on the ground next to a dispenser would cause the button to attach, which 
was obviously a bug. This plugin allows you to slap a button on the side of a dispenser in
a very natural way.

After pistons were added to Minecraft 1.7, the ability to attach levers to pistons seemed
like a logical addition.
