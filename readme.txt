DispenserButton - Put Buttons on Dispensers
Version: v0.1

The Minecraft 1.6 release removed the ability to place buttons on dispensers. Before 1.6, 
placing a button on the ground next to a dispenser would cause the button to attach, which 
was obviously a bug. This plugin allows you to slap a button on the side of a dispenser in
a very natural way.
